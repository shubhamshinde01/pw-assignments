Let the solution be T(n) = O(n), now let’s prove this using the induction method.
For that to happen T(n) <= cn where c is some constant.
T(n) = T(n - 1) + c
T(n - 1) = T(n - 2) + c
T(n - 2) = T(n - 3) + c
|
|
T(2) = T(1) + c
—------------------------ Adding all above equations
T(n) = T(1) + cn
Let us assume T(1) to be a constant value.
T(n) = k + cn
Therefore, T(n) <= cn
Hence we can conclude T(n) = O(n).
