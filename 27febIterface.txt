1. What is an interface in Java?
Ans: An interface in Java is a mechanism that is used to achieve complete abstraction. It is basically a kind of
class that contains only constants and abstract methods.

2. Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an Interface?Explain with an example
Ans: Only abstract and public modifiers are allowed for methods in interfaces.

3. What is the use of interface in Java?
Ans: There are many reasons to use interfaces in java. They are as follows:
a. An interface is used to achieve full abstraction.
b. Using interfaces is the best way to expose our projectâ€™s API to some other project.
c. Programmers use interfaces to customise features of software differently for different objects.
d. By using interface, we can achieve the functionality of multiple inheritance.

4. What is the difference between abstract class and interface in Java?
**Abstract Class:**
- Cannot be instantiated on its own; may have abstract and concrete methods.
- Provides a common base for related classes with a partial implementation.
- Can have constructors and various access modifiers.
- Example:
```java
abstract class Shape {
    int numberOfSides;
    Shape(int sides) {
        this.numberOfSides = sides;
    }
    abstract void draw(); // Abstract method
}
